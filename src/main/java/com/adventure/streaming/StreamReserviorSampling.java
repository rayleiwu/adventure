 * Assume that you have the memory to store k elements. Store the first k elements in the memory in an array. 
 * Now when you receive the nth element (where n > k), generate a random number r between 1 and n. 
 * If r > k discard the nth element. Otherwise replace the rth element in the array with the nth element.

This approach will ensure that at any stage your array would contain k elements 
that are uniformly randomly selected from the input elements received so far.
